    <h2 id="basics">Learning to code? Here's some tips!</h2>

    <h3> A note on code editors</h3>
    <p> There are <em>dozens</em> of code editors out there, each with it's own features, and honestly, the features are
      great, but you can use pretty much any text editor to write code. When I started playing around with coding, I used the
      preinstalled Notebook app on my laptop. There's a few steps you have to do to see your page
      save the file and open it in your browser. Which you can do through File Explorer, or the equivalents for
      Macbooks. Just find the file, and tell it to open the file in your chosen browser.
      You do have to reload the browser every time you change the code, which you get used to. I use <b>Visual Studio Code</b>,
      it has tons of features for free, I have been using it for a year now, since I began coding, and it has a feature
      where it will explain the element and link the reference from Mozilla Developer
      Network</a>, so you can see how it works. 10/10.<br> I have also used <b>Sublime Text</b>, which wasn't for me.
      The actual coding experience was good, but the auto save was a pain to find, and kept turning off.
      My favorite is actually an extension, which they made an app for, called <b>Web
        Maker</b> It has a live reaction I will link all
      these in the<b> <a href="#resources">resources section.</a></b> If you
      plan on using Javascript, you need to download the app, but otherwise, you can just use the extension ,which works
      offline, which is a major bonus when you don't have steady internet access.  My go to for coding answers is <b>Stack Overflow: it's basically Quora for developers. You can ask questions, people will asnwer, you can help other people with coding problems, and they're adding AI to the search engine to help find answers to most accurately answer questions!</b></p>
    <h3 id="advanced">Web Development Courses</h3>
    <p>There are thousands of courses, free and paid. Some even garauntee jobs after the course. I think I've taken 8
      since I started, just to absorb everything I can. Here's the 4 I loved and learned from:
    <ol>
      <li><b> FreeCodeCamp.</b> 10000% free, and they offer a certificate once you complete the course. Bonus:
        They
        have a forum where you can find virtually any coding question out there. They link some questions to the
        corresponding lesson, and there's just so much to learn. I recently completed the responsive web design, which
        is amazing, I learned a lot from the course. I had already taken... 5 different courses at this point, and I
        still learned a lot. They teach you how to make animations, quizzes, and some other fun stuff. They have a
        couple other courses I plan on taking: there's a calculus course I belive, I want to take to get ahead in
        college, where my nerdy butt is planning on majoring in computer science.
        They also offer a job opprotunity after you complete so many hours on the website. <b>100/10</b>
      </li>
      <li> <b>App Academy</b> Pretty good course, They offer a paid course, but you can take it for free. It
        doesn't offer nearly as much... support? I didn't finish the course, honestly. However, I learned a lot from this course. The course takes a while to complete, I belive they said on average 6 months to complete. They give you the ability to work at your own pace, and if you spring for the paid course, it's a little more structured. In short, good course, <b>9/10</b> </li>
      <li>
        <b>Career Foundry. </b> Oh my gosh, y'all. This is a 5 day course. On HTML, CSS, and a teensy bit of
        Javascript. The course is mostly video based, with examples and explanations under the video to help you follow
        along. Through this course, I got the outline for my offical portfolio, which from there I took into my own
        hands and redesigned about 8 times. This is a free course, but you do have to sign up with your email. They
        email you the link to the lesson every day. They also offer a paid course for the full course, but I just wanted
        a refresher in designing websites. In the paid version, I'm 99% positive they offer you a job match.
        <b>10/10</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Khan Academy</b> This is where I started, at 14, with absolutely no idea what I was doing. I stumbled
        across it when I was doing some practice because I had failed a math test and needed some help understanding the
        solution. Note: This was only offered through their website last thing I knew. They do break the lessons down
        nicely, and I learned a ton from them, in only a few weeks. Great course for beginners, or those who just need a
        review on the basics. <b>10/10</b>
